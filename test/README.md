# Overview 

In this folder there are two types of tests:

* first_unit_tests.js : run with Mocha (using Node.js)
* koans.js: run with Jasmine (using the browser)

# Learning unit testing
First we study how to test JavaScript code that has been written for 
Node (using module.exports). We use Mocha as the test runner. The goal
is to understand how to write unit tests, understanding RSpec flavoured 
frameworks.

# Learning JavaScript
Then we go deeper into the language using automated tests to discover 
its behavior. These kind of tests are called "koans", bringing the metaphor
from Buddhism. They run in the browser but we could also make then run 
with Node.
